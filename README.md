HOW THE GAME WORKS
Each time you get to the portal on the other side your score your
score will go up by 1 and you will be teleported back to the start.
If you get hit by one of the radioactive beatles that are crawling
across the screen however then you will lose all of your points and
will be set back at the beginning.
If you beat your current highscore it will then be added to the score
board at the top.

HOW TO PLAY
Use the arrow keys to move your player(the rock), across to the other side.


Good luck
